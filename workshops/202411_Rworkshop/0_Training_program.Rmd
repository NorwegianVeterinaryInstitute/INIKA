# Program to run by madelaine about training order and content 
> Trying to reduce the load - brain ...and have a way to come back for repeats day after
> example whonet test data 


# Before we come: Setup  

# 1. Introduction (to review - ca ok)
- state of mind 
- what to expect
- additional resources (you can come to that later)

# 2. Basic R and github with Rstudio (to review - ca ok)

- creating / open R project 
- git usage in Rstudio
- Using a notebook in Rstudio 
- Basic of R programming language - with R studio interface
  - installation packages 
    - R notions ...about R objects (not in depth)
      - some common data types
      - awareness 
      - help introduction
      - small intro functions
      - sub-setting / indexes
      - a bit of view of objects 
      
- Saving your code and notes. 
  - push / pull to github

# 3. Basic R for data analysis
> data from Human (Kobo toolbox)

- A good organisation of your project for data analysis
- First steps in data analysis
  - Reading a data frame
  - checking and setting correct data types 
    - data types (review, and add)
  - Obtaining a fast overview of the data contained in a dataframe
  - Object Visualization (code and Rstudio environment)
  - Getting a fast summary of the data contained in your dataframe
    - counts (col, row)
    - factors and levels (summary table / tally)

- Data frame manipulation with dplyr 
  - filtering
  - mutating
  - changing values (eg. NA and spaces) 
  - selecting columns 
  - group by
  - summary 


# Where 
? - decimals ... warning ! not done -> do that during transformation 
- ? where: joining data frames
(ensure data quality, what do I have)
# R and whonet

- connecting to a sqlite database and getting the data contained in tables (for whonet)
- data exploratioon and visualization
  - tables of levels factors for the different variables
  - reproducing whonet graphs 
  
- data wide and long format 
  - example: trick for making boxplots from long format 


# Eventually 
- github and zenodo - can show them article 
- functions using dplyr / tidyverse ... oops

##  Creating or recreating an environment 
We use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

R environment setup 
```{r renv setup}
library(renv)
```
