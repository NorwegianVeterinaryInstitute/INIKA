## Before we come: Setup

At arrival :

-   [ ]  Control before starting the data course
-   [ ]  Rscript to run to install packages ? or Renv ? 

## Introduction (to review - ca ok)

-   [ ]  Goal of the course
-   [ ]  what to expect and state of mind
-   [ ]  what about using AI to write code ?
-   [ ]  additional resources you can use to learn more, here and
    through the course

## Basic R and github with Rstudio (to review - ca ok)
 
 > learning how to use a R markdown document and git backup, small intro to R programming language

Starting point -`learning_R` git repo has been cloned locally

-   [ ]   Rstudio usage: creating / opening a Rproject
-   [ ]   Git used to backup notes and code via Rstudio. Workflow
-   [ ]   .gitignore file exercise (setup at the same time)
-   [ ]   Using a notebook in Rstudio: anatomy, text, code and rendering
-   [ ]   Exercise Using a R markdown document & Fast overview of R programming language (introduction terms and running things in cells) ! THIS NEED TO BE EXPLAINED DURING THE COURSE 

> We have during the course here : 
- installation packages and loading them
- taking notes in Rmarkdown and runnign cells
- R notions ...about R objects (not in depth)
  -   some common data types
  -   introduction to use help
  -   small intro functions
  -   sub-setting / indexes
  -   a bit of view of objects
  -   notions in R - different ways to do things
  -   pipes 
  -   some tricks 
  -   Saving your code and notes to git and push to github.
- Using git in R to backup your code in github (add - commit - push)
  
-   [ ]   Exercise : Printing your code in a word document


## chap 3. Basic R for data analysis (TO continue )

> data from Human (Kobo toolbox)

-   A good organisation of your project for data analysis

-   First steps in data analysis

    -   Reading a data frame
    -   checking and setting correct data types
        -   data types (review, and add)
    -   Obtaining a fast overview of the data contained in a dataframe
    -   Object Visualization (code and Rstudio environment)
    -   Getting a fast summary of the data contained in your dataframe
        -   counts (col, row)
        -   factors and levels (summary table / tally)

-   Data frame manipulation with dplyr

    -   cleaning colum names ( values (eg. NA and spaces, special characters))
    -   selecting columns
    -   mutating
    -   filtering
    -   Finding specific columns
    -   arranging raws by values in a columns  
    -   saving into a spreadsheet 
    -   summary (base::)
    -   checking if values are unique (ID)
    
    
    -   group_by


      
Exercises to go further (we do not need to do all). Solution are patterns the can reuse.   
    
All in the spirit of inspecting if data if of proper quality and detecting 
mistakes or inconsitencies . 
    

## Where

? - decimals ... warning ! not done -\> do that during transformation -
? where: joining data frames (ensure data quality, what do I have)


## Data from a database (Whonet) and merging datasets. 

-   connecting to a sqlite database and getting the data contained in
    tables (for whonet)
-   data exploratioon and visualization
    -   tables of levels factors for the different variables
    -   reproducing whonet graphs
-   data wide and long format
    -   example: trick for making boxplots from long format

## Eventually

-   pulling from github - recovery of what has been done and
    collaboration
-   github and Zenodo - can show them article
-   writing functions using dplyr / tidyverse ... oops

### Creating or recreating an environment

We use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

R environment setup for a reproducible project

```{r renv setup}
library(renv)
```

## ToDos 

 - [ ]  as Håkon if more things need to be added.
 - [ ] run tutorial by madelaine
