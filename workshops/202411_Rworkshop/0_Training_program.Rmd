## Before we come: Setup

At arrival :

-   [ ]  Control before starting the data course
-   [ ]  Rscript to run to install packages ? or Renv ? 

## Introduction (to review - ca ok)

-   [ ]  Goal of the course
-   [ ]  what to expect and state of mind
-   [ ]  what about using AI to write code ?
-   [ ]   additional resources you can use to learn more, here and
    through the course

## Basic R and github with Rstudio (to review - ca ok)
 
 > learning how to use a R markdown document and git backup, small intro to R programming language

Starting point -`learning_R` git repo has been cloned locally

-   [ ]   Rstudio usage: creating / opening a Rproject

-   [ ]   Git used to backup notes and code via Rstudio. Workflow

-   [ ]   .gitignore file exercise (setup at the same time)

-   [ ]   Using a notebook in Rstudio: anatomy, text, code and rendering

-   [ ]   Exercise Using a R markdown document & Fast overview of R programming language (introduction terms and running things in cells) ! THIS NEED TO BE EXPLAINED DURING THE COURSE 

> We have during the course here : 
- installation packages and loading them
- R notions ...about R objects (not in depth)
  -   some common data types
  -   introduction to use help
  -   small intro functions
  -   sub-setting / indexes
  -   a bit of view of objects
  -   notions in R - different ways to do things
  -   pipes 
  -   some tricks 
  -   Saving your code and notes to git and push to github.
  
-   [ ]   Exercise : Printing your code in a word document


## chap 3. Basic R for data analysis (TO continue )

> data from Human (Kobo toolbox)

-   [ ]  

-   A good organisation of your project for data analysis

-   First steps in data analysis

    -   Reading a data frame
    -   checking and setting correct data types
        -   data types (review, and add)
    -   Obtaining a fast overview of the data contained in a dataframe
    -   Object Visualization (code and Rstudio environment)
    -   Getting a fast summary of the data contained in your dataframe
        -   counts (col, row)
        -   factors and levels (summary table / tally)

-   Data frame manipulation with dplyr

    -   cleaning colum names ( values (eg. NA and spaces, special characters))
    -   selecting columns
    -   mutating
    -   filtering
    -   Finding specific columns
    
    
    -   summary (base not summarize)
    -   group_by
    -   arranging columns  
      
    Exercises to go further (we do not need to do all). Solution are patterns the can reuse.   

    
## Where

? - decimals ... warning ! not done -\> do that during transformation -
? where: joining data frames (ensure data quality, what do I have)

## R and whonet

-   connecting to a sqlite database and getting the data contained in
    tables (for whonet)
-   data exploratioon and visualization
    -   tables of levels factors for the different variables
    -   reproducing whonet graphs
-   data wide and long format
    -   example: trick for making boxplots from long format

## Eventually

-   pulling from github - recovery of what has been done and
    collaboration
-   github and Zenodo - can show them article
-   writing functions using dplyr / tidyverse ... oops

### Creating or recreating an environment

We use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

R environment setup

```{r renv setup}
library(renv)
```
