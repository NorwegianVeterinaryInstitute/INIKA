## Before we come: Setup

At arrival :

-   [ ]  Control before starting the data course
-   [ ]  **Rscript to run to install packages ? or Renv ?** Need to do one and try - this could help - This MUST be done at the end of the course preparation, however to be sure we have all ? ( We all have installed the needed packages and Programs?)





## Introduction (to review - ca ok)

-   [ ]  Goal of the course
-   [ ]  what to expect and state of mind
-   [ ]  what about using AI to write code ?
-   [ ]  additional resources you can use to learn more, here and
    through the course

## Basic R and github with Rstudio (to review - ca ok)
 
 > learning how to use a R markdown document and git backup, small intro to R programming language

Starting point -`learning_R` git repo has been cloned locally

-   [ ]   Rstudio usage: creating / opening an Rproject
-   [ ]   Git are used for backup notes and code versioning via Rstudio. Workflow
-   [ ]   .gitignore file exercise (setup at the same time)
-   [ ]   Using a notebook in Rstudio: anatomy, text, code and rendering
-   [ ]   Exercise Using a R markdown document & Fast overview of R programming language (introduction terms and running things in the cells) ! THIS NEED TO BE EXPLAINED DURING THE COURSE 

> We have during the course here : 
- installation packages and loading them
- taking notes in Rmarkdown and runnign cells
- R notions ...about R objects (not in depth)
  -   some common data types
  -   introduction to use help
  -   small intro functions
  -   sub-setting / indexes
  -   a bit of view of objects
  -   notions in R - different ways to do things
  -   pipes 
  -   some tricks 
  -   Saving your code and notes to git and push to github.
- Using git in R to backup your code in github (add - commit - push)
  
-   [ ]   Exercise : Printing your code in a word document


## chap 3. Basic R for data analysis (to review - ca ok)

> Data from Human sampling (Kobo toolbox)

-   A good organisation of your project for data analysis

-   First steps in data analysis

    -   Reading a data frame
    -   checking and setting correct data types
        -   data types (review, and add)
    -   Obtaining a fast overview of the data contained in a dataframe ("I think we need to explain what is a dataframe)
    -   Object Visualization (code and Rstudio environment)
    -   Getting a fast summary of the data contained in your dataframe
        -   counts (col, row)
        -   factors and levels (summary table / tally)
        -   using pipes

-   Data frame manipulation with dplyr (osv.)

    -   cleaning colum names ( values (eg. NA and spaces, special characters))
    -   selecting columns
    -   mutating
    -   filtering
    -   finding specific columns
    -   arranging rows by values in the columns  
    -   saving into a spreadsheet 
    -   summary (base::)
    -   checking if values are unique (ID)
    -   group_by
    -   count and creation of simple contingency tables
    -   filtering out rows with poor data quality (using filter on ID) 
    -   exporting dataset to file (csv)
    -   if_else and case_when to replace missing values
    -   count and summary functions (contingency tables) in dplyr
    -   some basic plotting
    -   exporting object to rds file

Exercises to go further (we do not need to do all). 
Solutions are patterns they can reuse.   
    
All in the spirit of data inspection to ensure proper quality: Which includes 
detecting mistakes or inconsistencies. 
Learning why its important not to modify the 
raw data, doing so by code allows to detect errors and allows transparency
of our choices. 
    

## chap 4. Data from a database (Whonet) and merging datasets. (todo)

-   connecting to a sqlite database and getting the data contained in
    tables (for whonet)
-   joining data frames
-   visualization : reproducing WHONET graphs

-   data wide and long format ? (not sure we have the data for that)
    -   example: trick for making boxplots from long format


<!-- I  think it will be actually more than enough material 

## Eventually

-   pulling from github - recovery of what has been done and
    collaboration
-   github and Zenodo - can show them article
-   writing functions using dplyr / tidyverse ... oops

? - decimals ... warning ! not done -\> do that during transformation -
