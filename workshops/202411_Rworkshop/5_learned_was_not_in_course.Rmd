# What did you learn and was not written in the course :

- Writing code needs to be spelled correctly (and exactly). As a beginner its 
not easy to see those kind of mistakes (it can be complicated too also when 
more experienced)
- Spaces, and special symbols (such as ?\/:) in file names and column names are 
not a good idea (they make you work more difficult). Keep to use underscores as 
separators for example. 
- quotes and brackets comes in pairs and are important. Not using them correctly 
will lead code that might not work.
- exploring the layout of a software and its options (eg through the meny) is a 
good idea. It will help you progress faster.



## Specific to Rstudio 

- press `Esc` if the console is _waiting for more instructions_ (when it starts 
  by the symbol `+`). The cause of this is mostly cause by brackets or quotes 
  that have not been closed.
- The error messages are informative. They can point you to the type of problem 
  existing in your code 
   - file not existing / not found : is 99% of the time the path or filename is 
   not correct
 - warning message are informative, but are not necessarily errors. They are 
   there to inform you that something might not be as you expected.


## Gloassary 

### General IT

- **path** : the location of a file on your computer. It is a series of folders 
  separated by `/` (or `\` on windows).
- **file name** : the name of a file.

### Specific to R studio

- to render : the action of transforming a Rmarkdown file into a document (html, 
  pdf, word, etc)


# Bonus 

How can you make such a presentation while using Rmarkdown?

- Install this revealjs package 
```{r}
install.packages("revealjs")
```
