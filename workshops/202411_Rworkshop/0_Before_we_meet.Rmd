# Installation & readings

Rstudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes it
easier to write and execute R code.

R is a programming language that is used a lot for data analysis and
statistics. We will introduce you to its usage. Time is short, please :

-   [ ]  Install R studio - Non commercial = Rstudio Desktop (free
    edition). Visit [posit
    webpage](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for
    installation.

-   [ ]  Get familiar with some basic vocabulary : Rstudio interface
    (bellow)

<img src="https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/rstudio-panes-labeled.jpeg" alt="panes" class=".img1"/>

Note: Should you want to know more, the guided tour for
[Rstudio](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/) is available.

-   [ ]  Have a look at the following video: [Rmarkdown: what it is and
    its potential
    usages](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html) We
    will use Rmarkdown to run code during the course, this will also
    allow you to take notes at the same time
    
- [ ]   if you are uncertain of what are the best practices for registering and organizing 
your data please read this tutorial, particularly the section of 
[spreadsheet best practices](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_keeping_data_tidy/#content).
NB: Tools like KoboToolbox and WHONET are usually useful to help following those principles
when registering data, but understanding more about the reasoning behing those requirements
is best.  

- [ ]  Please install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) version control 
utility on your PC and read [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics.html) 
to understand why version control is a fantastic tool.

- [ ]  Please create a [github account](https://github.com/) if you do not have 
one. You can eg. follow 
[this tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account)


_This can be more challenging, if you have enough time to try_: 

You will need to create a ssh key (The starts is the most difficult! last step, 
but it is worth it !)

- [ ]   Please try to create a ssh-key, following
[this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)


- [ ]   Please try to connect your github account to your Rstudio.

# EVE do Think - that will be alot alone already ... we need planning how much time we can have 
<!-- Madelaine --> 
- [ ]   On github each student can have gihub own folder or make furk ? 

- create subfolder for each student 
- We will furk Inika project in each account 
- 
- 

create a repository where you will be able to work on the code 
for INIKA project



# TODO EVE !!! AD link 
<!-- but I want by ssh --> 


<mark><b>PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU DID NOT MANAGE THIS BEFORE WE MEET.</b></mark>
We can eg. have a look with an online meeting if necessary.**


# Why to do this ? - reproducible science and Open data science 

The way we will work will help us to do reproducible research. It will 
help you (and us) to organize the data analysis work and document what you 
have done, including the reasons behind your choices.
The YOU 3 month from Now might not remember the reasoning and all the 
steps you have done in your analyses, but this will be essential information
for publication and manuscript revision. 

Moreover, working this way, will allow you to start setting up your analyses 
BEFORE all the data are collected. You will be able to rerun all your code
using updated data. This is helping you being proactive. 

What are the <u>requirements of reproducible research ?</u> 
The following article mention  [10 Rules of reproducible research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)

1. For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced
2. Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps
3. Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used
4. Version Control All Custom Scripts
5. Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats
6. For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds
7. Always Store Raw Data behind Plots
8. Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to Be Inspected
9. Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results
10. Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results

We will see that using R and Rstudio can help you to relatively easy follow all 
steps but 4 and 10. The latest, which require using a version control system 
like Git, and eventually associated platform like github (or another system for public
access eg. zenodo). 

<mark><u>WARNING:</u> NEVER PUT YOUR DATA ON GITHUB (unless you are really sure)
DO PUT your data on github for this project!.

We wont have time to go into details with git and github. 


But if you feel like it, you can learn Git for version control (it can be used with 
the command line - aka `Terminal` panel that is available in Rstudio):  
- [Git-Novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) is a good lesson to start with.


# Preliminary training program 

- github and R - get started with a project
- data wrangling
- data exploration and visualisation
