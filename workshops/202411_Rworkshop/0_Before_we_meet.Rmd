# Installation & readings

Rstudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes it
easier to write and execute R code.

R is a programming language that is used for a lot for data analysis and
statistics. We will introduce you to it's usage. Time is short, please :

-   [ ]  Install R studio - Non commercial = Rstudio Desktop (free
    edition). Visit [posit
    webpage](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for
    installation.

-   [ ]  Get familiar with some basic vocabulary : Rstudio interface
    (below). Names of the windows are in red.

<img src="https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/rstudio-panes-labeled.jpeg" alt="panes" class=".img1"/>

Note: Should you want to know more, the guided tour for
[Rstudio](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/) is available.

-   [ ] i Have a look at the following video: [Rmarkdown: what it is and
    'it's' potential
    usages](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html) We
    will use Rmarkdown to run code during the course. This will also
    allow you to take notes at the same time.
    
-   [ ]  Install the following packages/metapackage in R, by typing exactly the 
command below in Rstudio **console** and then pressing `enter`. We will explain later
during the course (we will install other packages). This will require some time.


```{r show code - do not run, echo=TRUE,  eval = FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
```


    
- [ ]   If you are uncertain of what are the best practices for registering and organizing 
your data please read this tutorial, particularly the section of 
[spreadsheet best practices](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_keeping_data_tidy/#content).
NB: Tools like KoboToolbox and WHONET are usually useful to help following those principles
when registering data, but understanding more about the reasoning behind those requirements
is important.  

- [ ]  Please install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) version control 
utility on your PC and read [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics.html) 
to understand why version control is a fantastic tool.

- [ ]  Please create a [github account](https://github.com/) if you do not have 
one. You can eg. follow 
[this tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account)


_This can be more challenging, if you have enough time to try:_ 

You will need to create a ssh key (The starts is the most difficult! last step, 
but it is worth it !)

- [ ]   Please try to create a ssh-key, following
[this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)


- [ ]   Please try to connect your github account to your Rstudio, 
you can have a look to [this tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github) 
can be helpful.

**<mark><b>PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU DID NOT MANAGE THIS BEFORE WE MEET.</b></mark>
We can eg. have a look during an online meeting.**


# Why we need to do this ? It's about Rproducible science and Open data science
This part will be discussed in the course. 

The way we will work will help us to do reproducible research. It will 
help you (and us) to organize the data analysis work, and document what you 
have done, including the reasons behind your choices.

Three months from now YOU might not remember the reasoning and all the 
steps you have done in your analyses. Documenting what you are doing at the 
same time you are doing it, is a very good practice. 

This will save you time and struggles. What you have done will be essential information
for publication and manuscript revision. 

<!-- lab journal to data journal-->

Moreover, working this way, will allow you to start setting up your analyses 
BEFORE all the data are collected. You will be able to re-run all your code
using updated data. This is helping you being pro-active. 

What are the <u>requirements of reproducible research ?</u> 
The following article mention  
[10 Rules of reproducible research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)

> 1. For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced
> 2. Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps
> 3. Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used
> 4. Version Control: Use it for all Customized Scripts
> 5. Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats
> 6. For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds
> 7. Always Store Raw Data behind Plots
> 8. Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to Be Inspected
> 9. Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results
> 10. Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results

We will see that using R and Rstudio can help you to relatively easy follow all 
steps but 4 and 10. The latest, which require using a version control system 
like Git, and eventually an associated online platform like github that allows 
to store your code on the web. Github in turn can be used during the 
publication and can facilitate the creation of DOI via integration with Zenodo. 
This then allows people to cite your data analysis work and code!

<mark><u>WARNING:</u>
- NEVER PUT YOUR DATA ON GITHUB, only the code to process the data 
</mark>

We might not have time to go into details with git and github, but we will try to


But if you feel like it, you can learn Git for version control (it can be used with 
the command line - aka `Terminal` panel that is available in Rstudio):  
- [Git-Novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) is a good lesson to start with.


# Preliminary training program 

- github and R - get started with a project (understand the basic principles)
- data wrangling
- data exploration and visualization (ensure data quality, what do I have)
- eventually ... going further
