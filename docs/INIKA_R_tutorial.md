-          Record the AST results in WHONET (Jannice will provide a “configurated lab”= Template) that should be suitable for this purpose.

-          Perform analyses of some of the AST data using WHONET.

-          Learning how to use R and the R Studio to write R code for data management and data analyses, and make sure how to merge data from different sources using the same ID ( Key) in R.

Even if we will not have so much real data in November, it is worth doing this with data already available, but we might also provide some testdata to be used for learning purposes.

1. I agree with you the students be trained on MALDITOF, R software and WHONET. However, for Anna the MALDITOF

- [ ] search carpentry - I think was also AMR analysies or so in incubator ...

- [ ] Aim, make the learn they can be themselves ... 

# Getting started with R for data analysis

R is a software for statistical data analysis (free)

Generally there is good introduction courses, that you can use to learn several computing languages, how to do reproducible science, learn different bioinformatic tools osv to do science, developed by the [carpentries community](https://carpentries.org/community/) . We will use some of their resources;  
I used those to prepare this tutorial, and adapted those for your purpose. 

- [Reproducible research in R]
- [R for reproductive Scientific analysis]

You can also find courses for Free on the web, eg, Coursera^1 ,  and [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/). The resources for learning are not lacking. What is lacking well is type to explore it all ! . Therefore do not hesitate to seek  guidance on how to start. How can you find efficiently good resources to learn when you have no idea what you should actually learn ?  The solution is talk to people and ask, and also eg. ask on specialized forums what you should know. 

Some other recommended learning resources, that we will not use now but can be useful for you are given on [INIKA github repository](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/INIKA) 

# Before we start - For you : 
## Need for reproducibility 
- We need to be able to recreate all your analyses from the raw data (data that have been collected). 
	- [ ] Have a look at the articles and points mentioned in [Reproducible research in R]
- This means that every analysis you are going to do, and the whole process of data analysis will be documented. The document is a script/code that you will be running to do your analyses
- You will be able to add comments also - to explain your reasoning, for you and for others.  
- This will enable you to redo your analyses more rapidly, should an error be detected (or helping you to eg. satisfy reviewers). NB: Its normal that errors exist, top be open about our code allows to detect and correct those. 

## Data - good data practices 
excel course 

## Ways to work with R 
- Rmarkdown VS script  
	- a way to document everything you do - including your reasoning
	- possible to split step after step 


## Saving env and data so you can restart next day ! same point 


# Data processing: example based on your data 






### Simplifying the table 
- remove redundant data (make it readable)
- 
### Having an overview of the data that has been registred in each field

### Filtering out data 
- That should not have been collected
- That should not be used in this project 

### Joining tables together 

### Understanding the data and what you can do with 
- data exploration 
-  Data description : understanding what you can obtain and which questions you can answer ... (enough data per type osv ) 
- takes time ... use your knowlege
- what question do you want to answer in your research 


# Later ...
### Data analysis 

### Preparation tables for publication 

### Preparation graphs for publication
